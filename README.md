# Data-Driven Estimation of Quadrotor Motor Efficiency via Residual Minimization

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the algorithms presented in our paper **"Data-Driven Estimation of Quadrotor Motor Efficiency via Residual Minimization"**.

The method formulates trajectory prediction residuals from quadrotor dynamics and solves a constrained optimization problem to recover motor efficiency parameters. To ensure robustness against outliers, the estimator employs **iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS)**, combined with a **primalâ€“dual interior-point method** that enforces physical constraints and guarantees numerical stability.
